See the sunset
The day is ending
Let that yawn out
There's no pretending
I will hold you
And protect you
So let love warm you
Till the morning
I'll stay with you
By your side
Close your tired eyes
I'll wait, and soon
I'll see your smile in a dream
And I
Won't wake before you go
And I'll
Still be your heartbeat
Feel the raindrops
The dawn without you
Watch that star rise
Eons without you
I'll stay with you
In your mind every single day
I'll wait and soon
We're stranded on the beach
In our dream
We part too soon
But in our love
There's a truth to find
The end is new
And tomorrow we must reach far
To be heard
See the sunset
The day is ending
Let your heart sigh
See the sunset
See the sunset
And I'm gonna stay with you
But I won't stray away from the truth
And I am still living two worlds and you
See the sunset
